# Non-Invasive Anemia Detection from Conjunctival Images

## Overview

This repository hosts the project "Non-Invasive Anemia Detection from Conjunctival Images," a computer vision-based approach to detecting anemia using images of the conjunctiva. This method offers a non-invasive alternative to traditional blood tests, making anemia screening more accessible and efficient.

## Repository Contents

- `Non_invasive_Anemia_Detection_from_Conjunctival_Images.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook developed in Google Colab, containing the code for image processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
- `anemia dataset-20231113T154638Z-001.zip`: A zipped file containing the dataset used for model training and testing.

## Dataset

The provided dataset includes images of the conjunctiva from various individuals, labeled as either anemic or non-anemic based on clinical data. The dataset is crucial for training and validating the machine learning model.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed, along with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Install necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

2. **Download and Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Unzip `anemia dataset-20231113T154638Z-001.zip`.
   - Place the dataset in an accessible directory.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `Non_invasive_Anemia_Detection_from_Conjunctival_Images.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells in sequence to train and evaluate the model.

4. **Explore and Modify**:
   - Feel free to experiment with different model architectures, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques.
